Warning: Due to the nature of serverless deployment, there may be a delay in the first request going through. This delay can take up to 30 seconds, so please be patient when making the first request to the ChowTime application. Subsequent requests will be much faster, as the server will have already started.

## How it works
ChowTime allows a group of people to create a poll to choose a restaurant or a food item to eat. The users can create a poll by adding the available food options or restaurant names. The application provides a unique link that can be shared with the group members to vote on the poll. The group members can then select their preferred option, and the application automatically tallies the votes. The results are displayed in real-time, allowing the group to see the winning option quickly.
